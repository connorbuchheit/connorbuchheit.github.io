## Connor Buchheit

Hi! I'm Connor. I'm interested in how systems work — especially where math, code, and real-world constraints intersect.

I recently graduated from Harvard with degrees in Applied Math, Computer Science, and Germanic Languages and Literature. My background spans high-performance computing, machine learning systems, and mathematical theory.

This site is a place for notes, small projects, and things I’ve found interesting enough to write down.
