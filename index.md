# Hey, I'm Connor Buchheit

I studied math and computer science, and I’m interested in systems, algorithms, and how things work under the hood. This site is a place for notes, small projects, and things I’ve found interesting enough to write down.

## A Bit About Me

Most of my work revolves around applied math, software engineering, and machine learning. I'm especially into:

- Low-level optimization and parallel computing
- Machine learning systems and interpretability
- Functional programming, category theory, and other things I don't *really* know but keep trying to learn

## What You'll Find Here

I use this site as a kind of public notebook. You might find:
- Project write-ups
- Code experiments
- Short blog posts (occasional and informal)

## Elsewhere

- [GitHub](https://github.com/connorbuchheit)
- [Blog](/blog)

Thanks for stopping by.
