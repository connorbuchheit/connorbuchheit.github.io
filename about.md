# About Me

Hi — I'm Connor. I studied math and computer science, and most of what I do sits at the intersection of the two.

I like building systems that work well, thinking about how things fail, and occasionally writing about it. My interests include:

- Parallel and high-performance computing
- Machine learning systems and interpretability
- Scientific computing, algorithms, and compilers
- Languages and abstractions — the mathy kind and the human kind

This site collects my notes, experiments, and side projects. Some things are polished, others are half-baked — I like keeping it that way.

## Where I've Been

I’ve done research in machine learning and scientific computing, worked on systems-level code, and built tools for analyzing complex data. I'm especially interested in problems where performance, correctness, and interpretability all matter.

## Outside of Work

When I'm not coding or debugging something weird, I’m probably reading about history, working through a math paper, or learning languages (natural and programming). I also spend way too much time thinking about writing.

## Reach Out

I’m always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just a good conversation.
