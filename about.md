# About Me

Hi — I'm Connor. I studied applied math, computer science, and Germanic languages and literature at Harvard, graduating in Spring 2025 with both an A.B. in Applied Mathematics and Germanic Languages and Literature and an S.M. in Computational Science and Engineering.

Most of what I do sits at the intersection of theory and engineering. I’m especially interested in:

- High-performance computing and parallel systems  
- Machine learning infrastructure and interpretability  
- Scientific computing, algorithms, and mathematical modeling  
- The mathematical theory behind computational problems — whether in reinforcement learning, computer vision, or large-scale simulation

## Research & Projects

I’ve done research in large language models and computational neuroscience, worked as a teaching fellow for a graduate-level HPC class, and I avidly build in my free time. I'm equally drawn to the big-picture questions of research and the nitty-gritty problem-solving of engineering.

This site is meant for my notes, experiments, and side projects, ranging from quick drafts or thoughts to more polished pieces.

## Outside of Work

When I’m not coding or debugging something weird, I’m probably reading one of literature, philosophy, or a research paper; learning languages (I speak 4 well and more satisfactorily); playing tennis or watching reality TV; going down Wikipedia rabbit holes; or writing — when I have the time (or the discipline).

## Reach Out

I'm always open to new ideas, collaborations, or just a good conversation.
